# dfs algorithm

# 1. create a 'visited' set to track explored nodes for fast lookup
# 2. create a 'stack' (lifo) to control traversal order
# 3. add the start node to both 'visited' and 'stack'
# 4. repeat until the stack is empty:
#    - remove the top node from the stack
#    - process the node (e.g., print)
#    - if node is the goal → stop and return success
#    - otherwise, explore all neighbors in reverse order
#    - for each neighbor not in visited:
#         → add to visited
#         → add to stack
# 5. if stack empties without finding goal → return failure

# depth-limited dfs algorithm

# 1. define a recursive dfs function with parameters:
#       node, goal, current depth, path, visited set
# 2. if current depth exceeds depth_limit → stop recursion
# 3. mark current node as visited and add to path
# 4. process the node (e.g., print with depth)
# 5. if node is the goal → return current path
# 6. if depth < depth_limit:
#       - for each neighbor not in visited:
#           → recursively call dfs with depth + 1
#           → if goal found in recursion → return path
# 7. if no goal found at this branch → backtrack:
#       - remove node from path and visited
#       - return None
# 8. after recursion finishes:
#       - if result_path exists → print goal and path
#       - else → print goal not found within depth limit
