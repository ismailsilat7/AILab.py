# UCS finds the least-cost path from start to goal

# 1. create a priority queue (pq) storing tuples (node, cumulative_cost)
# 2. create a 'visited' set to track explored nodes
# 3. create 'cost_so_far' dict to store minimum cost to reach each node
# 4. create 'came_from' dict to track parent for path reconstruction
# 5. add start node to pq with cost 0, mark cost_so_far[start] = 0, came_from[start] = None
# 6. repeat while pq is not empty:
#    - sort pq by cumulative cost to simulate priority queue
#    - pop node with lowest cost
#    - if node already visited → skip
#    - mark node as visited
#    - if node is goal → reconstruct path using came_from, print path and total cost, stop
#    - otherwise, explore neighbors:
#         - for each neighbor, compute new_cost = current_cost + edge_cost
#         - if neighbor not in cost_so_far or new_cost < cost_so_far[neighbor]:

#              → set came_from[neighbor] = current_node
#              → add (neighbor, new_cost) to pq
# 7. if pq empties without finding goal → print "goal not found"
