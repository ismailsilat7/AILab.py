"""
A*  finds the **shortest path** from a start node to a goal node.
- It uses both 
    g(n) = actual cost from start to current node
    h(n) = heuristic estimate of cost from current node to goal
- Total cost: f(n) = g(n) + h(n)

1. Initialize the frontier with the start node and f(n) = g + h.
2. Initialize a visited set to track explored nodes.
3. Initialize g_costs dictionary to store the lowest cost to reach each node.
4. Initialize came_from dictionary to reconstruct the path.
5. While the frontier is not empty:
    a. Sort the frontier by lowest f(n) and pop the node with the smallest f(n).
    b. If this node is the goal:
        - Reconstruct the path using came_from and return it.
    c. Mark the node as visited.
    d. For each neighbor:
        - Calculate new g(n) cost from start.
        - Calculate f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
        - If neighbor not visited or new g(n) is lower than previous:
            - Update g_costs and came_from
            - Add neighbor to frontier
6. If frontier empties without finding goal, return "Goal not found".
