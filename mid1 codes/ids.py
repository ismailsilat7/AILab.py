# IDS performs repeated DLS increasing the depth limit until the goal is found or the max depth is reached

# 1. define a recursive depth-limited search (dls) function with:
#       node, goal, current depth, path
# 2. check if current node is the goal → if yes, add to path and return True
# 3. if depth limit reached → return False
# 4. if node has no children in the tree → return False
# 5. for each child of the node:
#       - recursively call dls with depth - 1
#       - if recursion returns True → add current node to path (backtracking) and return True
# 6. if no children lead to goal → return False

# 7. define iterative_deepening function with start, goal, max_depth
# 8. for depth = 0 to max_depth:
#       - initialize empty path
#       - call dls(start, goal, depth, path)
#       - if goal found → print path (reversed) and stop
# 9. if loop ends without finding goal → print "goal not found within depth limit"
