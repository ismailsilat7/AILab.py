# bfs algorithm

# 1. create a 'visited' set to track explored nodes for fast lookup
# 2. create a 'queue' (fifo) to control traversal order
# 3. add the start node to both 'visited' and 'queue'
# 4. repeat until the queue is empty:
#    - remove the front node from the queue
#    - process the node (e.g., print)
#    - if node is the goal → stop and return success
#    - otherwise, explore all neighbors
#    - for each neighbor not in visited:
#         → add to visited
#         → add to queue
# 5. if queue empties without finding goal → return failure
