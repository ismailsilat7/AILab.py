"""
Genetic Algorithm works with a population of candidate solutions.
Over generations, better solutions evolve using selection, crossover, and mutation.

1. Population: Set of candidate solutions.
2. Individual (Chromosome): One solution (e.g., N-Queens board).
3. Fitness Function: Measures how good a solution is.
4. Selection: Choose best individuals as parents.
5. Crossover: Combine parents to create children.
6. Mutation: Randomly modify individuals to maintain diversity.

N-Queens Representation:

- State = list of size N
  Example: [1, 3, 0, 2]
  Index = row
  Value = column (ensures one queen per row)

Fitness Function:
- Counts NON-attacking pairs of queens.
- Maximum pairs = n(n-1)/2
- Fitness = non-attacking pairs / total pairs
- Goal: Fitness = 1.0 (perfect solution)

1. Initialize a random population.
2. Evaluate fitness of each individual.
3. Repeat until solution found or max generations reached:
    a. Select best individuals (parents).
    b. Apply crossover to generate new population.
    c. Apply mutation randomly.
    d. Replace old population with new one.
4. Return the best solution found.

STAFF SCHEDULING
- Goal: Assign staff to shifts while minimizing penalties.

Problem Representation:
- Schedule = 2D matrix
  Rows = staff
  Columns = shifts

  schedule[staff][shift] = 1 → assigned
  schedule[staff][shift] = 0 → not assigned

Fitness Function:
- Lower fitness is better (penalty-based)

Penalties:
1. Understaffed shifts:
   - If assigned staff < required → penalty added

2. Consecutive shifts:
   - If a staff works back-to-back shifts → penalty

1. Initialize random population
2. Evaluate fitness (penalty)
3. Repeat for generations:
    a. Select best individuals (lowest penalty)
    b. Apply crossover to create children
    c. Apply mutation randomly
    d. Replace old population
4. Return best schedule (minimum penalty)
