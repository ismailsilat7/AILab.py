"""
Beam Search explores a graph/tree by keeping only the best 'k' paths at each level (beam width).

1. Initialize the beam with the start node as a path with cumulative cost 0.
2. While the beam is not empty:
    Initialize an empty list of candidate paths.
    For each path in the beam:
        Check the last node:
            - If it is the goal, return the path and cost.
            Expand the node to generate successors:
            - For each neighbor, create new path & cumulative cost.
            - Add it to candidates.
    Keep only the top 'k' paths with lowest cumulative cost.
3. If the beam empties without reaching the goal, return failure.
