"""
Hill Climbing starts with a random solution and keeps improving it by moving to a better neighbor.

N-Queens Representation:
- State = list of size N
  Example (N=4): [1, 3, 0, 2]
  Index = row
  Value = column of queen

Heuristic Function:
- h(n) = number of attacking queen pairs
- Goal: h(n) = 0 (no conflicts)

Simple Hill Climbing:

1. Generate a random initial state.
2. Compute its heuristic (conflicts).
3. Repeat:
    - Generate all neighbors.
    - Find the first neighbor with fewer conflicts.
    - If found → move to that neighbor.
    - If no better neighbor → STOP (local optimum).
4. Return the current state.
